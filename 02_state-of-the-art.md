# State of the art

This chapter will describe a few versioning implementations in different kind
of software systems. The most important implementation is Jackrabbit, since
there already is a transport layer for Jackalope and it is an implementation of
the JCR specification, which the solution provided by this theses must also
fulfill.

The second approach to check is the one used by some Product Lifecycle
Management systems. The most important question for this approach is if it also
suits content management, which is the use case JCR and PHPCR was built for.

The last approach is the one used by Git and other version control systems. The
main focus will be on Git, since it gained a lot in popularity in the recent
years. The main question is the same as for PLM systems: Is this approach
suitable for the content management use case?
